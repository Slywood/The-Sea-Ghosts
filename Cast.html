            the cliffside. As he lay against a tree, passed out in the sun, the
            Sea Ghosts roused him. With a flash of gold and a wiff of rum Hubert
            was employed for the first time in his life. Since then he has
            joined the Ghosts on many an adventure, and has proven himself
            worthy of membership in the crew as a non-combatant. He currently
            serves as Spymaster for Tony Montazuza, Renowned Thief and
            Quickmage, and also Groundskeeper to the Cliffside Estate owned by

            The very first ally of the Sea Ghosts, responsible for the
            introduction of the party and the first person to assign them to a
            quest. More than just an employer, Anders was a friend to Tony
            Montazuza, Alfonso, and Davion. The Ghosts successfully recovered
            Anders' mothers' belongings from the Emperor of the Waves while
            encountering a Sahaugin and supernatural threat. Their success in
            that mission was ultimately pivotal in securing further mercenary
            work and developing further connections with high ranking city
            officials. Unfortunately, Anders was not safe in his own home. As it
            turned out, Anders' butler, Skarren Waverunner, was the head of a
            cult in the region known as 'The Scarlet Imperium'. Unbeknownst to
            anyone but himself, Skarren Waverunner accompanied his Master Anders
            and the Sea Ghosts on a mission in the Gulf of Nerina after it was
            uncovered that another member of Anders' household, Egart the
            accountant, was a member of the Scarlet Imperium when he killed
            Uvohs Copperbranch. During this mission, Skarren was discovered to
            be the 'Noble' and when confronted, slit Anders throat.

            Wolgar Windrune. Entire sagas could be written about the exploits of

            ferrying a group of adventurers to a shipwreck in the Gulf of
            Nerina, the mental toll upon his crew was significant. So much so
            that shortly after their return there was a mutiny. And so, Wolgar
            Windrune found himself without a ship or a crew. All was not lost
            however, shortly after the death of Uvohs Copperbranch the Sea
            Ghosts found themselves in need of an extra gun. Wolgar joined the
            party as they broke bread with Lizardfolk, tamed Thousand Teeth the
            Devourer, and faced off with Gulpa'Gor. In his final act of
            brilliance, Wolgar stole the crew's skiff and sailed to the Tower of
            Zamar where he led the Ghosts to find Xolec's new haven as well as
            their newest member, Lyrax Copperbranch. Wolgar found a sense of
            purpose and belonging with Xolec that had been missing since the
            mutiny and he elected to stay at the tower.

            Eliander enacted marshal law shortly after the deaths of Manistrad
            Copperlocks and Uvohs Copperbranch. Successful in large part, he was

            Ghosts noticed holy magic afoot and Wolgar Windrune took it upon
            himself to free the magically chained vampire. After his release, he
            immediately gorged himself on the corpse of Vito the Fixer before
            introducing himself. An alliance was formed and Xolec agreed to help
            gather information on the Scarlet Imperium in exchange for his
            freedom. He also delivered the body of Uvohs Copperbranch safely to
            Stonekeep. Since then, Xolec has made hearth in the Tower of Zamar,
            where he introduced the crew to Lyrax Copperbranch and set them on a
            quest to retrieve a 1500lb statue of Saint Cuthbert.

            used to rest in the socket lay a swirling black glass-like orb.
            Alfonso was able to remove the orb and in doing so experienced a
            vision of a deep sea rift with a seemingly infinite number of
            hostile creatures emerging from it. These creatures were making
            their way towards and island with an obelisk in the center. Tony and
