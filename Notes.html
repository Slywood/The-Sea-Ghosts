        <h2>Session One</h2>
        <p>
          The players arrive in Emerald Bay. Davion and Uvohs have been spending
          a few days in comfortable rooms at the Mariner's Guild, while Tony and
          Alfonso have been roughing it at the Kraken's Call tavern. The
          characters cross paths at the docks and realize they all have the same
          appointment with Anders Solmor, the richest man in Emerald Bay who has
          a job for them. Before they can leave the docks, however, the
          washed-up dead body of a missing girl (Morana Ungart) causes a stir
          among commoners. Asking around at the Mariner's Guild where she
          stayed, the players found her journal that included a plan for her and
          her brother to investigate rumors of gold alchemy inside the haunted
          house outside of town. Intrigued, but with an appointment, the players
          met Anders in his large manor and received a very specific job. Anders
          asked you to retrieve some belongings of his late mother's that should
          be aboard a ship that he owns, the Emperor of the Waves. The only
          problem is the Emperor and it's crew are rumored to have been
          destroyed some time ago, yet it somehow continues to sail out in the
          open sea. The Dwarven warship The Red Tide has been employed to
          transport them there and back. Then next the players set sail with the
          dwarves and Captain Wolgar.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Two</h2>
        <p>
          An absolute invasion in the middle of the night as Sahuagin came
          aboard. There was cold damage flying about, a charge from a megladon
          chariot, and in the end seven dwarfs were dead. But with the help of
          some well positioned thunderwave spells, an ignited oil lantern, a
          bloody mary scream, and a sleeping spell, you prevailed over the
          invaders. Captain Wolgar Windrune made you guests of honor aboard the
          ship as you feasted on roasted griffon and drank the finest rum and
          brandy from the captain's stash. As you rested through the night, the
          vast sea around you suddenly seemed much less knowable and much less
          comforting than when you set out that morning.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Three</h2>
        <p>
          A funeral at sea for the dead dwarves taken suddenly by the Sahuagin
          threat. The players familizarized themselves with some new magic loot
          including a cloak of elvenkind, a staff of Sekolah, and some nice
          potions. The next day was full of mixed emotions as the crew mourned
          those that passed and as night fell, the Emperor of the Waves came
          into view. Only hired for transport, the dwarves bid you good luck as
          you rowed a dingy up to the towering, ghostly, corpse of a ship. With
          multiple stealthy approaches made with grappling hooks and Alfonso's
          panther form, it soon became clear you were not alone aboard the ship.
          As a tall, barely humanoid in shape collection of tentacles and muck
          made itself known as we rolled initiative.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Four</h2>
        <p>
          Our Bard Dabbling Davion has had maybe the fight of his life and goes
          down to 0, he may even carry scars from this day moving forward.
          Alfonso sacrificed all the health of his panther form to drag his
          fallen comrade across the deck of the ship, being forced back into
          humanoid form along the way. With the aid of a healing spirit, Davion
          continued to fight on. Tony, seeing the damage these monsters could
          put out, took a ranged approach and began to snipe the creatures from
          afar, dealing significant damage. All the while Uvohs and his eldritch
          cannon pummeled the monsters from afar, making himself a priority
          target. When the monster had him cornered against the stairs he threw
          out a shield spell to defend himself from the blows. In an act of
          revenge, it was Davion who dealt the finishing blow with a dissonant
          whispers spell that melted the most dangerous foe.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Five</h2>
        <p>
          When we last left off you survived the sinking of the Emperor of the
          Waves by the tentacles of a giant octopus. What started as an
          encounter between Tony and four ghouls quickly escalated when Captain
          Krell, corrupted by some sort of fishlike transformation and a pact
          with an unfathomable force, spewed forth a void of hushed whispers and
          cold. Not too far into the conflict, the octopus made his presence
          known as he thrashed the sinking the ship in what became a multilevel
          combat and escape with the chest of Anders Solmor in hand. By the time
          the dust settled, three of you were unconscious at different times.
          There were health potions being thrown 60 feet, vicious maulings from
          our giant bear, and dozens of dexterity saving throws against
          tentacles. The players eventually escaped to a rowboat but not without
          having to outrun the determined Captain Krell who did not go down with
          his ship. In a desperate fight for his life that was finally cut short
          with the crack of Dwarven Muskets, Krell lay dead and you found
          yourself safely aboard the Red Tide again.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Six</h2>
        <p>
          Revelations abound in the safety of the Red Tide as you not only read
          about Captain Krell's encounter with a hoarde of fishfolk but a
          towering monolith on an island in the middle of the sea that they seem
          to worship. If that wasn't enough, you couldn't resist opening Anders
          Solmor's family chest. Inside was quite a bit of gold which Tony
          skimmed off the top of. There was also a collection of disturbing
          evidence pointing towards the Solmors being slavers and allies of the
          Reapers when it benefitted them. Uvohs takes a moment to try to study
          Krell's hand and even reach out to his god. Captain Krell's body is
          kept in a salted barrel aboard the ship.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Seven</h2>
        <p>
          Armed with new information, the players decide to let Anders look at
          the chest himself and if his reaction will imply his guilt one way or
          the other. In order to pull this off, Davion strums a sleep spell on
          the butler Skerran (not knowing that the sleep spell did not actually
          work). When they confront Anders in his room, he is an emotional wreck
          having just learned what the players learned the day before. Anders
          recommits his life to stopping the Reapers, or what's left of them,
          from causing harm to the bay. Anders leaves the players with a payday
          and an invitation to meet the rest of the city council the next day.
          The players have the night to themselves as they reach level 4!
        </p>
        <h2>Session Eight</h2>
        <p>
          Tony had himself a night out drinking and smoking with some goblins as
          well as at the Kraken's Call. When he turned in, he saw a vision of a
          faraway land and communed with his god. Davion sent a sealed bottle
          out to sea, straight down into the ocean, defying many of our
          understandings of how things float. He also penned a solemn tune to go
          along with the pain he experienced on the Emperor of the Waves. Uvohs
          crafted a few things, not least importantly, a new flying companion
          named Mango. As well as some sort of iron man power up and sent a
          letter ahead to Eliander Fireborn. Alfonso went full Moana as he also
          communed with a god but submerged in water and surrounded by the
          creatures of the sea, calling out and asking for an explanation of why
          he keeps surviving when he feels may have just gotten lucky.
        </p>
        <p>Following That:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Made your way into the council of Emerald Bay where you met each
            council member
          </li>
          <li>
            Tony made a quick joke that had Manistrad leaving the session, Eda
            seems to have admired your exploits so far, Eliander vetted you and
            is anxious to see how you perform, and Gellan kind of just hacked
            and laughed as this proceeded. You did notice Anders seemed a bit
            jolty and strange after a long night of contemplating his parents'
            legacy. Not wanting to cause any drama, you noted this and signed an
            employment contract from the city council.
          </li>
          <li>
            You then embarked on your journey with babe to the east 4 miles
            outside of town. Halfway there you met a weird old kook named Hubert
            who had actually been in the house before. You gave him 5 gold coins
            and he offered a little info in return. You arrived at the house as
            sun set and debated how to enter as strange blood sucking flying
            creatures circled the home. You took a direct approach which led you
            into a firefight with 3 gunmen. You killed one, one fled to his
            certain death, and the other, the Orc Korag, you interrogated and he
            gave information about the operation in the house's cellar. You
            eventually let him go as well and based on the other smuggler's
            fate, there is a chance that he also met a swift end. Afterwards,
            you investigated the house a bit, finding a few old books as well as
            the one-eyed Adonis bound and gagged in an upstairs bedroom. Uvohs
            struck with his firebolt spell and you freed him from his bonds and
            outfitted him with whatever spare weaponry you could. As you
            descended into the basement however, his demeanor changed. He seemed
            insistent all along that you all turn heel and head home while you
            still can. As you sat in the wine cellar, trying to investigate this
            mysterious corpse and plundering a bottle of vintage wine, Tony
            found something. A secret lever within the fireplace. As his hands
            gripped it, Adonis revealed his true self. The traitor springs at
            Tony's throat to get a cheap shop in with a poisoned cutlass as we
            rolled initiative.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Session Nine</h2>
        <p>
          The players destroyed Adonis and began to play detective as they
          learned he was hired by a masked noble in Emerald Bay with a smoker's
          cough. The players also learned of the head of this gang, Sanbalet,
          who's recent mana crystal addiction has caused him to act out in a
          violent streak, killing two commoners for no reason. The players
          busted into the cellar of the house and had another firefight which
          dropped Uvohs from some sick musket shots their snipers were pulling
          off. When the dust settled, the players had found some kind of lantern
          signaling system to a ship that smuggled goods in from out of town.
          The cellar continued into a cave system. With previous intel the
          players know it holds traps, large hobgoblin mercenaries, and the wiry
          wizard Sanbalet.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Ten</h2>
        <p>
          An explosive fight with Sanbalet filled the caves with arcane and
          blackpowder explosions. Emerging victorious, the players came away
          with mana crystals, mithril armor, an elven greataxe, and a stash of
          smuggled goods and weapons. They learned the Sea Ghost is captained by
          a man named Salamanca with a crew of 10 others. The quantities which
          are being bought here indicate the buyers are preparing for some kind
          of war. The players return at dawn to Emerald Bay and do a bit of
          shopping including meeting the gorgeous Kirona Kester who fashions
          some leather goods for multiple party members.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Eleven</h2>
        <p>
          the day before the Sea Ghost is due, the players Spent a lavish night
          at Primewater mansion getting wined and dined. Davion hit a nat 20 on
          spitting game to Aurora Oweland. Uvohs spoke with Uriel Plume, who
          told him about early storms occuring in sea before storm season, these
          storms have previously been caused by creatures rather than weather.
          Alfonso learned a little bit about taking the leap as an act of faith
          to Agwe. Gellan then raised a glass to our adventurers and the impact
          they've made in Emerald Bay in such a short time. Other residents
          despite their differences all agreed and you dined, you drank, you
          danced. You made sure to keep an eye on Gellan as through some social
          interactions you learned he undoubtedly has too much money to be a
          simple lumber trader. Later in the night, Davion took over in
          entertaining the crowd, and before the night was over Eliander briefed
          you on this job to vanquish or capture the sea ghost. He offered to
          supply any non-magical equipment you need. Alfonso made one little
          observation before the night was over, that Manistrad Copperlocks who
          dined at the table with her Dwarven miners looked sickly and pale and
          appeared to rush home at the end of the night looking ill. That night,
          the party went their seperate ways with some of them getting lucky.
          The next day you met up at your House (needs a name) to put together a
          plan for the Sea Ghost. Then you all agreed to spend the night
          unwinding before you confront these pirates in 24 hours or so. And
          that is where we pick up: in the Snapping Line tavern.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twelve</h2>
        <p>
          Honestly a pretty low key tavern session last time out. The Snapping
          Line Strength competition against Mo. Hubert took some bets as you
          found out he's been poking around town. He did tell you that Manistrad
          Copperlocks has been bed-ridden ever since attending the party at
          Gellan's. Tony asked him to keep an eye on the sitch. You proceeded to
          tie one on at the ole Snapping Line. There was some bets made, some
          wins, some losses, and some inter-party pickpocketing going on. The
          next morning you woke up hungover af and sailed your jolly boat up the
          eastern shore to your compound 4 miles outside of town. You then
          approached the danger sign and destroyed the haunted alchemist and his
          skeletons, plundering the magic items held within and potentially the
          secret to alchemy or at least a scam pretending to have the secret to
          alchemy.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Thirteen</h2>
        <p>
          The Sea Ghost arrives and an all out assault ensues as the entire
          session is dedicated to combat with 11 pirates. Davion deals the final
          blow with an entire gunpowder keg, instantly destroying most of the
          crew and some of the Sea Ghost itself. When the dust settles, two
          survivors remain that the party approached to interrogate.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Fourteen</h2>
        <p>
          Much comes to light in the aftermath of the fight. The Sea Ghost is
          full of 7,500 gold worth of smuggled weapons and goods as well as a
          Sea Elf Prisoner named Oceanus. All of the following is revealed in
          conversation:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-title">
          Sea Ghost Plunder
          <li>50 bolts of silk (2,500gp)</li>

        <ul class="list-title">
          Discoveries from the Sea Ghost
          <li>
            Oceanus was sent as an agent from a Sea Elf tribe called the Manaan.

          <li>
            The Lizardfolk have established a colony 10 miles from Emerald Bay

            The smugglers are amassing a small fortune in hopes of offering it
            to Aremag, which appears to be a drawing of jagged rocks in the
            middle of the sea.

          <li> With these two summons in hand you regrouped and

          </ul>
           We begin in the afternoon, about 2PM. For the purposes of
          time we will say you have about two courses of action left in the day
          as today has already been huge. You level up to level 5. You have
          Uvohs to worry about, you have sketchy cargo to worry about, and you
          have a midnight meeting that is optional. You also have an appointment
          with Eliander Fireborn first thing in the morning.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Seventeen</h2>
        <p>
          The party officially learns through convincing the servants in Anders'
          home, that Uvohs was murdered by the accountant Egart. In a swift
          escape, Egart has departed for San Citlan to broker some kind of
          illicit business deal. The party is devastated and calls out to Mango
          in desperation, but a reply is not heard. Determined and feeling ripe
          for revenge, the players learn of a suspicious figure, a fixer named
          Gracen Hoth, who is camped outside of town and hired to dispose of
          Uvoh's body.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Eighteen</h2>
        <p>
          You had a threatening meeting with Gracen Hoth who turned out to be
          using a fake name. You heard a proposal from the cleanup man, Vito
          Bellina, and his quickling minions inside his fancy tent. Ultimately,
          you decided to charm him and secure the remains of Uvohs Copperbranch
          for no cost. When the charms wore off things got a little ugly, some
          decent wounds were inflicted on our Bard friend Davion. Immediately
          after, you had to carry Vito's body downward beneath Crabber's Cove to
          make your meeting with Xolec. To the party's surprise, Xolec turned
          out to be an ancient vampire, imprisoned thousands of years ago by a
          Cleric. The party allowed Wolgar to carry Xolec off of his ancient
          seal and he immediately consumed part of Vito's unfortunate corpse.
          Extremely grateful, Xolec agreed to transport Uvoh's body for you as
          well as expose the Scarlet Imperium for you to destroy and avenge him.
          With little else exchanged, Xolec vanished into a cloud of mist and
          with a swarm of bats, vanished into the night. Now you emerge from
          Crabber's Cove, the town of Emerald Bay enveloped in a mysterious fog,
          and a distinctively cool temperature hanging over the water as you
          walk onto the docks and towards the Sea Ghost.

        <h2>Session Nineteen</h2>
        <p>
          Heavy RP session but it was necessary to debrief with Eliander after
          an extremely eventful few days. You guys had to perform an unexpected
          supernatural act to prove you are who you say you are when you
          arrived. This was because Eliander now has proof, through Manistrad's
          blood, that she was poisoned by a very expensive poison: Midnight
          Tears. Arresting Gellan not only for smuggling but for questioning in
          this murder was heavily discussed. More off-shore drama as you guys
          were paid for apprehending the Sea Ghost and then were offered the
          same fee to travel by sea to find out the Lizardfolks intensions in
          person, not knowing at this point whether they are friend or foe. You
          also blew Eliander's mind with the Scarlet Imperium information. He
          plans to raid the Solmor estate and bring in the guards but before
          that he was able to send a letter that got Anders and Skerran out
          safely. Now all of you plus Oceanus have been sailing for about 2 and
          a half hours on your newly cannon and war-drum equipped ship, you did
          a little potion shopping as well as secured some sending stones. Now,
          you have dropped anchor unexpectedly as to your starboard side about
          40 feet in to the coast, you noticed a wood elf defending a nest of
          some sort and struggling for his life against some savage Merrow
          attackers.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty</h2>
        <p>
          The players dropped anchor and attacked a small group of Merrow who
          were terrorizing a wood elf, the ranger Erevan of the Griffon Court.
          During the fight, Erevan was slain before you ultimately destroyed the
          Merrow with a combination of cannon fire and underwater combat. Erevan
          was survived by two Griffon eggs which the party now possesses as well
          as his armor, herbalist's kit, and magic berries. You also learned he
          was on his way to deliver these eggs to Ulorian, the River King, the
          leader of Yardosa. After this encounter the party debated lowering
          anchor at the nearby Tower of Zamar, ultimately decided not to risk
          any dangerous encounters and took a long rest in place. That night the
          party discussed the strategy for the Lizardfolk colony the next day.
          On a bright, humid ass morning, the sea ghost sailed to the mouth of
          the Dunwater River. The party entered the colony via the sea by way of
          a small cave. To their surprise, after an encounter with
          just the lizardfolk, they were berated by some asshole Koalinth
          goblinoids. Other species present in the water cave were the fish
          people Locathah and their giant sea eels as well as peaceful Merfolk.
          You were then introduced to Queen Saphara, who is assembling an
          alliance to take back the Lizardfolk fortress from the sea devils, the
          Sahuagin. In order to join this alliance as Emerald Bay, you have been
          charged with hunting and returning with the hide of Thousand Teeth the
          Devourer, a colossal killer crocodile lurking in the Stonetail
          Marshes.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-One</h2>
        <p>
          Sauriv shares that the shamans have observed creatures of both land
          and sea acting against what would be considered the natural order. You
          attempted to barter some lizard mounts but having used up your favor
          without an alliance secured, you set out on foot. You left Oceanus,
          Anders, and Skerran behind to make forrays into securing this alliance
          while you're away. In the Stonetail marshes you met not only annoying
          bugs and unbearable humidity but a small society of Bullywug frogfolk
          who turned out to be bloodthirsty marauders, if not musically
          talented. Although Alfonso went down at one point, your show of force
          was so swift through tidal waves, hypnotic music, and bullets, you
          were successfull and grabbed the small fortune they amassed as your
          own. That night during a long rest, a bat came piercing through the
          night magically to your exact location. Delivering a small piece of
          parchment containing coordinates and an invitation, this was mostly
          kept to Wolgar alone. The next day, you squared off against Thousand
          Teeth the Devourer, a colossal crocodile beast. The initial conflict
          was not looking good as Davion found himself in a snake trap and
          Wolgar quickly became apart of Thousand Teeth's gullet. It was the
          power of primal magic through animal friendship that pacified these
          beasts before they could deal any more damage. In a moment of
          vulnerability, Thousand Teeth presented Alfonso with a mysterious
          otherworldly orb lodged within his eye. Taking the hint, Alfonso
          ripped this orb from the socket, experiencing a plethora of bizarre
          divinations, a warning of a dangerous threat on the seafloor.
          Wolgar and Tony also touched the orb, experiencing visions and
          any skin that came in contact with the orb seemed to rob that skin of
          its natural pigment.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-Two</h2>
        <p>
          We began last session exhausted in the middle of the Stonetail
          Marshes. You decided to hike at a normal pace but without stopping to
          rest to get back to the colony. Right at sunset, through stealth and
          antics, you avoided a combat encounter with a nasty troll beneath a
          bridge, not without pickpocketing him. Eventually, you returned at
          nightfall to Dunwater, triumpantly securing the alliance with the
          lizardfolk. After watching a Sahuagin prisoner get executed once his
          guilt for Thousand Teeth's corruption was determined, you ate and
          drank and sang the night away. That morning, it was obvious that
          Skerran was unable to keep Wolgar from sneaking away. You followed the
          coordinates in his bed to the Tower of Zamar, a smuggler's den under
          new management. Xolec, still bound by his word to you, gave you the
          identity of two Scarlet Imperium agents as well as introduced you to
          Uvohs's brother. Skerran and Anders are completely shook. He also
          gifted you a boon for the Sea Ghost. So here you are on Firstday, the
          30th of Storm's end. A foggy and rainy day continues at midday as you
          spent the morning sailing and learning of this place. You have some
          business to attend to elsewhere, but I'd be remiss if I didn't offer a
          menu of smuggler's den activities if anyone wants to before we set
          out.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-Three</h2>
        <p>
          So last session we resumed at the Tower of Zamar by grabbing this map
          of the gulf. From there, you talked
          to the head honchos again. Xolec gave you a quest to retrieve a 1,500
          pound statue of St. Cuthbert from a shipwreck called The Marshall.
          Kaladek gave you some very interesting information. Gellan has been
          arrested, however: Guther Stoutmaw that has been found guilty of
          Manistrad's murder. Guther is set to be hanged but Gellan's fate is
          undecided. Doing a favor for his former business partner, Kaladek asked
          you put in a good word for Eliander to secure Gellan a fate that
          doesn't involve prison or death. In exchange, Gellan has information
          on a potential job to steal a sentient painting, the Portrait of
          Constantori. This Portrait is said to have belonged to many important
          people in the gulf in the past two centuries, and the eavesdropping it
          has done is said to hold priceless information. You did a little
          shopping, buying some necromany scrolls, a druidic totem, and some
          odds and ends adventuring gear. You then decided fuck it, and set out a
          couple of hours away to go diving for the wreck of the Marshall. When
          you got there, you met not only a few harpy's nests but an anchored
          ship along with two siblings, Aella and Lykos Carmaclo and their
          bonded iron golem, Lucky. It turns out, their father was a devout St.
          Cuthbert follower as well as a skilled Stone Mason. He carved the
          giant statue, that after a scuff with the harpies, Lucky retrieved. You
          decided not to stop these innocent people from their mission and
          elected to let them take the statue back to their home city of Akros
          on the Olikos Peninsula. In return, they gave each of you 100gp and
          presented a symbol of St. Cuthbert that will allow you to use the
          Scrying spell. You decided your target was going to be the Noble, and
          having failed the wisom save, the Noble is about to be revealed to
          you.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-Four</h2>
        <p>
          We began last session aboard the Bat Guano with a realization. A
          realization that you have been sailing with the Noble for half a week.
          Along with this realization came memories of close calls and quick wit
          where Skerran was just able to stay out of sight. His goals these last
          few days unclear at this point. This horrendous betrayal immediately
          set off some emotions. Lyrax plunging into the ocean, Tony trying to
          stop him, Alfonso and Davion scurrying to make a plan, your new
          friends confused. While this scuffle broke out, the man himself walked
          onto the deck to have a smoke, immediately sensing something was
          different. You were able to shoo him and Anders away for the moment
          and prepare an ambush with your new friend's Iron Golem. But it
          appears Skerran was able to know when he was cornered. With the power
          of an eversmoking bottle, he masked his appearance enough to present
          himself with a knife at Anders' throat. He attempted reason with you
          before starting a fight to death, the party would not accept his
          parlay. Knowing he was cornered, he brutally took Anders' life, who
          probably still didn't understand what was happening until the very
          end. With this tragedy, hell broke loose on the Sea Ghost. There were
          bombs, poison, Tony was dropped, then saved by Lyrax so he could blast
          off cannon fire into Skerran's direction. Alfonso went full polar bear
          and eventually inflicted serious damage after squaring off with the
          stairs. Lyrax sent bursts of force damage hurling across the ship after
          reviving Tony. Davion became invisible, animated a rope, and
          ultimately struck the final blow of an exploding powder horn
          connecting with Skerran's face. As death claimed another on the Sea
          Ghost, Aella and Lykos paid their respects and ask you to look for
          them at the temple of St. Cuthbert if you ever find yourself in
          Meletis. As the sun set and night falls, you found yourself drinking
          the night away in mourning of Anders and celebration of the triumph of
          combat. Though, as the night hours droned on, it became obvious that
          you were not the only beings listening to the music of Davion on that
          pitch black night at sea. Two hovering spectres, occasionaly moaning
          in lament, approached the ship. Not one to ask questions, Lyrax dinged
          each with blasts of force damage, and combat ensues.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-Five</h2>
        <p>
          We left off when a night of mourning Anders was interrupted by two
          ethereal undead. When combat broke out, Davion did his best to calm
          them, but they were determined to attack. Tony sent a wave of necrotic
          damage their way that seemed to have no effect. With a terrifying
          visage from the other side of the grave, they aged Lyrax 100 years and
          Tony 30 years in an instant. That was enough for the rest of the party
          to see, as Alfonso threw them prone with a tidal wave and Davion
          effectively ended the fight with a debilitating hypnotic pattern. The
          two still present day aged members of the party then dropped sails and
          raised anchor to your base, the haunted manor 4 miles outside of
          Emerald Bay. After a few hours, you arrived successfully without
          causing a stir with nearby martial law patrols. You found Hubert had
          been holding the place down since martial law was enacted and feeding
          both Babe and Starbolt in the stable. Alfonso gave him 200 gold to
          secure some coffins for the bodies, and the party updated Hubert as
          you finally got a long rest off successfully.
        </p>
        <h2>Session Twenty-Six</h2>
        <p>
          We opened up last session after a long rest at your manor outside of
          town. Having sent Hubert ahead, he returned with a couple of nice
          coffins in the cart and surprisingly was accompanied by Ingo the Drover
          who saw him in town. Ingo was able to give you some letters of passage
          into the city of Emerald Bay during martial law, which allowed you to
          slip into the city as a group of elders on the back of a cart. The
          party was able exchange some coin for healing from a cleric of Agwe,
          Uriel Plume. Uriel also offered Alfonso some sage advice regarding his
          faith to Agwe and his relationship with his genasi form. A quick walk
          across town was interrupted by the swinging corpse of a now dead
          Guther Stoutmaw, hanged with a sign above reading "traitors ye be
          warned". When you arrived at Eliander's house, you found his office
          surrounded by a zone of truth, making difficult and sometimes
          impossible to lie. With no other choice, you laid all of the fortunate
          and unfortunate truths of the past four days upon him. Full of rejoice
          at the death of the noble and sorrow at the death of Anders, he raised
          a glass or two of his finest blackwood whiskey with you. He gave you a
          bit of background information on San Citlan and the party decided
          their immediate course of action to be to take out the remaining
          imperium agents, with an invasion of the Sahuagin stronghold set
          for two weeks from now. By chance, Davion also received a letter at
          the end of this meeting. A letter from his father, King Ta'Loth of the
          Selu Maraar sea elf tribe.
